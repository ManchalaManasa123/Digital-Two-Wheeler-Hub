Project title : Digital-Two-Wheeler-Hub

➤ Problem Statement

Problem Statement ID: HACXPB003

Problem: Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse bikes, scooters, and EVs, search and filter by brand, price, or fuel type, view detailed specs with images, compare models side by side, use EMI and fuel cost calculators, check upcoming launches, explore showrooms, and book test rides or sell used bikes.

➤ Summary 

Vahan Bazar is a web application that redefines the two-wheeler marketplace experience by offering buyers and sellers a unified platform for discovery, comparison, and transactions. The platform caters to bikes, scooters, and electric vehicles, enabling users to browse, search, and filter listings by brand, price, mileage, and fuel type.
To help users make informed decisions, Vahan Bazar integrates detailed specification pages with images, a side-by-side comparison tool, and built-in EMI and fuel cost calculators. These features allow buyers to evaluate affordability and running costs, making the purchase process more transparent.
Beyond used vehicles, the platform provides insights into upcoming launches, a directory of showrooms, and the ability to book test rides online. Sellers, including dealerships and individuals, can list and manage their vehicles through a dedicated dashboard that simplifies inventory management and boosts visibility.
The application is powered by a modern and scalable tech stack: React.js (or Vue/Angular) for the frontend, Node.js/Flask/Django for the backend, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB/SQLite for database management. The architecture is designed for smooth deployment, responsive design, and future integration with services like digital payments and inspection reports.
Vahan Bazar ultimately aims to become the go-to marketplace for two-wheelers, combining transparency, convenience, and dealership integration. It goes beyond traditional classifieds by offering smarter tools, dealership support, and a seamless end-to-end user experience.

➤ Problem Understanding

The two-wheeler market is fragmented, making it difficult for buyers to find reliable information, compare models, calculate affordability, and discover upcoming launches or nearby showrooms, while sellers and dealerships lack digital tools to efficiently manage inventory and reach the right customers. Existing platforms largely act as basic classifieds without features like financial calculators, side-by-side comparisons, or test ride booking, leading to friction, low transparency, and reduced trust in the buying and selling process.

➤ Proposed & Prototype Plan

Proposed Solution:

Digital Two-Wheeler Hub is designed as a smart marketplace for two-wheelers. The platform connects buyers, sellers, and dealerships by offering discovery, comparison, and transaction tools in one place. It addresses key gaps in existing solutions: lack of transparency, absence of financial tools, and limited dealership integration.

Prototype Plan:

we aim to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates the core user flows:

•	Buyers can browse and filter available two-wheelers.

•	Sellers/dealers can create and manage listings with images.

•	Users can view detailed specs of each listing.

•	Simple EMI and fuel cost calculators will be integrated for decision support.

•	A clean and responsive UI will ensure usability across devices.

Stretch goals include side-by-side comparison, upcoming launches module, test ride booking, and dealer dashboards.

➤ Uniqueness & Innovation

Digital Two-Wheeler Hub stands out from traditional classifieds by offering smart decision-making tools alongside a marketplace. Features like EMI and fuel cost calculators, side-by-side model comparison, and upcoming EV launches make the platform future-ready. Unlike competitors, we also provide a test ride booking flow and a dealer inventory management dashboard, bridging the gap between buyers, sellers, and showrooms.
By combining marketplace listings with financial insights, dealership integration, and EV support, Digital Two-Wheeler Hub transforms the two-wheeler buying and selling journey into a transparent, data-driven, and trustworthy experience. This innovation positions our solution not just as a listing platform, but as a complete ecosystem for two-wheeler discovery and transactions.
