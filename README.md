Project title : Digital-Two-Wheeler-Hub

➤ Problem Statement

Problem Statement ID: HACXPB003

Problem: 

To create a two-wheeler marketplace web application through which customers can explore bikes, scooters, and EVs, search and filter by brand name, price, or fuel type, see in-depth specs with pictures, compare two models side by side, utilize EMI and fuel cost estimators, check future launches, visit showrooms, and book test rides or sell used bikes.

➤ Summary

Digital-Two-Wheeler-Hub is a web application that transforms the two-wheeler marketplace experience through providing buyers and sellers with a single platform for browsing, comparing, and buying. The platform serves motorcycles, scooters, and electric vehicles, with users being able to browse, search, and filter listings based on brand, price, mileage, and fuel type.

To enable customers to make well-informed decisions, Vahan Bazar combines in-depth spec pages with photos, side-by-side comparison functionality, and integrated EMI and fuel price calculators. These enable customers to analyze affordability as well as running costs, which makes the buying process more transparent.
Apart from used cars, the site offers information on forthcoming launches, a showroom directory, and online booking for test rides. Sellers, both dealerships and individuals, are able to list and deal with their cars using a special dashboard that automates inventory management and increases visibility. dealership integration. It is more than conventional classifieds in that it provides intelligent tools, dealership assistance, and an end-to-end user experience without any hassles.

➤ Problem Understanding

The two-wheeler industry is fragmented, and it is tough for consumers to access credible information, compare models, compute affordability, and locate upcoming launches or nearby showrooms, whereas dealerships and sellers do not have digital solutions to manage inventory effectively and target the correct customers. Current platforms mostly function as simple classifieds without the availability of features such as calculators for finance, side-by-side comparisons, or booking a test ride, resulting in friction, low transparency, and lowering trust in the buying-sell cycle.

➤ Proposed & Prototype Plan

Proposed Solution:

Two-Wheeler Hub is a smart marketplace for two-wheelers. It brings buyers, sellers, and dealerships together through discovery, comparison, and transaction tools on one platform. It fills significant gaps in current solutions: no transparency, no financial tools, and minimal dealership integration.

Prototype Plan:

we seek to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that realizes the essential user flows:

• Buyers will be able to search and filter listings of available two-wheelers.

• Sellers/dealers will be able to create and manage their listings with photos.

• Users will get to see comprehensive specs of every listing.

• Easy EMI and fuel price calculators will be built in for decision-making support.

• A responsive and clean UI will provide usability across platforms.

Stretch goals are side-by-side comparison, upcoming launches module, test ride booking, and dealer dashboards.

➤ Uniqueness & Innovation

Digital Two-Wheeler Hub is different from the usual classifieds as it provides intelligent decision-making aids in addition to a marketplace. The platform is future-ready with features such as fuel type, side-by-side model comparison, and upcoming launches of EVs. We also offer a test ride booking funnel and dealer inventory management dashboard, unlike others, closing the gap between buyers, sellers, and showrooms.

By integrating marketplace listings with financial information, dealership integration, and EV compatibility, Digital Two-Wheeler Hub offers a seamless two-wheeler buying and selling experience that is transparent, data-driven, and reliable. This makes our solution not only a listing platform but a full-fledged ecosystem for two-wheeler discovery and transactions.
